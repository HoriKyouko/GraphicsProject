# GraphicsProject
Tim and Steve Final Project for COP 5725 with Sumanta Pattanaik.

# Images
All images were found on https://hdri-skies.com/ these images
can be found in the images folder and are in their own seperate
folders based on the time of day of the photos. Each photo is named
depending on which direction you are looking at on each axis. We also
store the respective irradiance map we computed in this folder as well
as a .out file.

# JavaScript files
All our JavaScript code is housed in the js folder. Our main project file
is run off of project.js and our index.html file loads in all the JavaScript
files with the script tags.

# Steve
Our IrradianceMapGenerator.java is housed in the Steve folder. This is the
file we used to generate all the points on our Irradiance Map. There is 
another file called IrradianceMapGeneratorWithThreads.java that was our
attempt at speeding up our generation by using threads to multitask our
generation, but everytime we ran it we would get the incorrect results and we
could not figure out what was wrong.

Everything else should be understandable and if you have any questions you
can email us and we'll answer as soon as possible.
